# PU Result PDF to JSON

This is a simple program that I created to process Pokhara University Results into JSON for easier use within applications.

## Steps for using
1. Install requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Create a folder called `results` and put result PDFs inside of it.
3. Then run the `convert_to_json.py`.

### Note:  Please note that the program is not perfect yet and may fail on some PDF files. I am still working on it and hopefully will be fixed soon
